# Javascript-Quiz-Game

## Description
This webpage is an interactive quiz to help users practice questions about JavaScript. There is a timed element that begins when the user clicks the start button. The quiz cycles through ten questions. Correct answers gain the player ten points, while incorrect answers remove ten seconds from the game clock. At the end of the game the user can add their initials to compare with other game players. This project allowed me to practice incorporating JavaScript into an HTML webpage. The webpage can be accessed here: https://flying-s-ranch.github.io/javascript-quiz-game.
