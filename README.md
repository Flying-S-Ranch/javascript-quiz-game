# Javascript-Quiz-Game

## Description
This webpage is an interactive quiz to help users practice questions about JavaScript. There is a timed element that begins when the user clicks the start button. The quiz cycles through ten questions. Correct answers gain the player ten points, while incorrect answers remove ten seconds from the game clock. At the end of the game the user can add their initials to compare with other game players. This project allowed me to practice incorporating JavaScript into an HTML webpage. The webpage can be accessed here: https://flying-s-ranch.github.io/javascript-quiz-game. 

## Usage

## Credits
Tutor Scott McAnally advised me on the best way to organize the quiz content within an array (lines 24-42), and that I should iterate through the array by setting the index as a variable (lines 109-206).

I learned how to remove a child element (lines 168-173) from a W3 Schools article called "HTML DOM Element removeChild()". This article can be accessed here: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_node_removechild.asp

Items within quotes in the quiz questions are taken from notes made during week three lectures.
